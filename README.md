# FDS-2HW_testing
We will re-derive and implement logistic regression and optimize the parameters with Gradient Descent and with the Newton's method. Also, in this exercise we will re-derive and implement Gassian Discriminant Analysis. We will use datasets generated from the make_classification function from the SkLearn library. Its first output contains the feature values 
 and 
 for the -th data sample. The second contains the ground truth label 
 for each corresponding data sample.
